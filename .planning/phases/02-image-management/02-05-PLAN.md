  <action>Human verifies the complete image management system in the browser.</action>

  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the server: `cd packages/server && bun run dev`
2. Start the web app: `cd apps/web && bun run dev`
3. Open http://localhost:5173

**IMG-01 Upload:** Drag multiple images onto the upload zone. Also try clicking to select files. Verify images appear in the grid after upload.

**IMG-05 Compression:** Check that uploaded images are compressed (file size in storage/images/ should be smaller than originals for large images).

**IMG-06 Thumbnails:** Verify thumbnails load quickly in the grid. Check storage/thumbnails/ directory has generated files.

**IMG-07 Duplicate Detection:** Upload the same image again. Verify a "duplicate" warning appears and no duplicate entry is created.

**IMG-03 Grid View:** Scroll through the grid with many images. Verify smooth scrolling (virtual scrolling should keep DOM nodes minimal). Resize the browser window and verify columns adjust.

**IMG-04 Preview:** Click any thumbnail. Verify full-size image opens in lightbox. Test keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Escape).

**IMG-02 Delete:** Select multiple images using checkboxes. Click "Delete" in toolbar. Confirm deletion. Verify images are removed from grid and files are deleted from disk.

**IMG-08 GIF Convert:** Select a single image. Click "Convert to GIF". Verify a .gif file downloads.
